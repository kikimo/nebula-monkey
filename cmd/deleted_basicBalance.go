			1. remove two nodes and balance data
				+ wait for balance to complete or fail
			2. add two nodes and balance data
			+ wait for balance to complete or fail
			3. random partition network
			4. keep inserting data
			5. check result
			5.1 balance succ of failed?
				5.2 node offline?
			5.3 ok to insert edge?
				5.4 data consistency

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// basicBalanceCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// basicBalanceCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
